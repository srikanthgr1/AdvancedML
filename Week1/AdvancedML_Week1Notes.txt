Produt Placement
Custoemr Segmentation
Affinity Promotion

Support - Frequency of the item(s) appearing out of total transactions
Confidence -  likelihood of an item being purchased given another item is purchased

L = 1 : Items are independent 
L > 1 : Items are corellated 
L < 1 : Items are negatively corelated 



RHS = Consequent 
LHS = Antecendent 



Questions from Apriori for Class 

1) What are the other metrics for the MBA 

2) How is relearning done; Is it like inclusive of old and new data / incremental learning Ex: My algorithm has learnt till lastweek After this week Will i feed data again from past + new / Can i just do learning on new data and add the learning to past data 

3) If I have to tune my Algorithm / improve accuracy Since Confidence is similar to NaiveBayes Rule Can I use NaiveBayes and do the MBA Analysis 

4) How do we do MBA For a new product; I have introduced a new product and I know that the product A goes well with another product B 
how will we make Maching to know this 
Can you give some example and ways to implement it 
Some thoughts I have are first do classification and then feed it for MBA; But How do i do ?

5) What is USer/product metrics 

6) How to include the price, other attribs to be considered along with frequent item set 
how to write a custom function for this ?

7) Can you explain leverage and convition in the frequent itemsets 

8) Can we factor seasonal info into algo ( timeSeries factor) 

9) Many libraries got downgraded when I installed mlextend lib in Anaconda 
Will it be an issues anywhere else ?
